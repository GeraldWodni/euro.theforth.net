### Hardware requirements
The following hardware is required:
- A headset or another setup which ensures no echoing is received from your end.

You cannot attend the conference with a built-in microphone. If you cannot get a headset and cause interference, you will be muted and will be limited to replying by text.

The following hardware is strongly recommended:
- A webcam which points at your face
- A lamp which illuminates your face.

If there is a wall behind your monitor consider bouncing light of it with a lamp, so we can see your lovely face. Alternatively shine light onto you from an angle.

### Software requirements

__TL;DR: get Firefox, sign up at the link you will be getting via email on the 27th August.__

The following software is required:
- Fairly recent Firefox browser (please update when possible)

The following software is strongly recommended as a fallback option:
- Fairly recent Chromium based browser (please update when possible)
- Zoom Client

We will be using the web-based chat-application [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/) - no installation required, hosted by Forth Committee Members to help privacy concerns.
You will receive a signup link after the registration closes.
All communication is within this chat-application, we ask you to sign in within the `Get together` timeframe.

For the video conferences themselfes we will be using [BigBlueButton](https://bigbluebutton.org/) hosted by [senfcall.de](https://senfcall.de/).
__Links to the conference rooms will be provided in chat-application Mattermost__.
As this EuroForth is free of charge, we ask you to consider donating to senfcall _after_ the conference.

If this should fail we will fall back to [Zoom](https://zoom.us/). Consider installing their client beforehand.

Thanks to everybody who has been testing these systems with us, we are not considering any more alternatives at this time.
