The conference will be preceded by the Forth standards meeting which starts on September, 8th.

Both, meeting and conference will be hosted in the Internet.

## Programme

_Please Note: Times are subject to change, we are working on the online schedule._
_We are trying to incorporate as much of your suggestions as possible._

### Hardware requirements
The following hardware is required:
- A headset or another setup which ensures no echoing is received from your end.

You cannot attend the conference with a built-in microphone. If you cannot get a headset and cause interference, you will be muted and will be limited to replying by text.

The following hardware is strongly recommended:
- A webcam which points at your face
- A lamp which illuminates your face.

If there is a wall behind your monitor consider bouncing light of it with a lamp, so we can see your lovely face. Alternatively shine light onto you from an angle.

### Software requirements

__TL;DR: get Firefox, sign up at the link you will be getting via registration email (opens 19th August 2021).__

The following software is required:
- Fairly recent Firefox browser (please update when possible)

The following software is strongly recommended as a fallback option:
- Fairly recent Chromium based browser (please update when possible)
- Zoom Client

Like last year we will be using the web-based chat-application [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/) at https://chat.forth-standard.org - no installation required, hosted by Forth Committee Members to help privacy concerns.
You will receive a signup link in via email after you registered on this site.
All communication is within this chat-application, we ask you to sign in within the `Get together` timeframe.

For the video conferences themselfes we will be using [BigBlueButton](https://bigbluebutton.org/) hosted by Gerald Wodni, as [senfcall.de](https://senfcall.de/) was dropping some connections from the US.
__Links to the conference rooms will be provided in chat-application Mattermost__.

If this should fail we will fall back to [Zoom](https://zoom.us/). Consider installing their client beforehand.

Please visit our testing call which will be announced in [chat](https://chat.forth-standard.org/), especially if you had issues last year.

# COVID 19 / Coronavirus
We tried hard to make a physical conference work, it did not. If you want some details:
- The original hotel went bankrupt
- Backup hotels were not very responsive
- Looking for further alternatives we found a good hotel, but we were notified that they are closing for August but will be back for sure in September - well we have heard that before
- A lot of regulars are unable to attend due to travel restrictions
- Even more regulars have voiced concerns related to COVID 19
