# COVID 19 / Coronavirus

As with so many events this year EuroForth also has to take the pandemic into consideration. \
Therefor the Registration process will be delayed and announced in July.

<!--
## Registration process

The following procedure is very different from previous years, please bear with us.

1. Please register if you want to attend, also if you do not know yet if you will be able to attend. Registrations this year are not binding until the prepayment has been received, see below.
2. The decision for __`Rome`/`Online`__ will be announced on __20th July__ 13:37
    - If __`Online`__ is decided, the conference and the standards meeting will be held online, on the same dates.
    - If __`Rome`__ is decided, proceed to 3.
3. Please transfer at least 30% of your total as soon as possible, it must arrive on our account by 3rd August to ensure your room reservation (required by the hotel - we are forwarding the collective payment). Feel free to transfer the full sum right away, should we need to cancel at short notice, we will return all but the 30% downpayment to the hotel. Please transfer the remainder to arrive no later than 31st August.
4. We assume that the conference can now take place and the pandemic is nothing more but a conversational topic.
5. If however the conference has to be cancelled because of a _2nd wave_ or the like, the conference will be moved to 2021, your 30% down payment are not refundable in that case, but will be valid for the next year in the same hotel.

If you have any open questions to this process, do not hesitate to email us ( Claudia -dot- Wodni on Gmail, Subject: "EuroForth 2020 Registration").
