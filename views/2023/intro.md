## Partner activities

Unfortunately we cannot offer a guided partner track this year.
However: our Hotel is next to a train station which allows easy commute in under an hour into Rome's center.
We will provide meeting points and times as well as some suggested sites,
so you can group up and enjoy the city with fellow Forther's partners.
