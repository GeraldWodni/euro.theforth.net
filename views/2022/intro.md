The conference will be preceded by the Forth standards meeting which starts on September, 14th.

Both, meeting and conference will be hosted online.

## Programme

### Hardware requirements
The following hardware is required:
- A headset or another setup which ensures no echoing is received from your end.

You cannot attend the conference with a built-in microphone. If you cannot get a headset and cause interference, you will be muted and will be limited to replying by text.

The following hardware is strongly recommended:
- A webcam which points at your face
- A lamp which illuminates your face.

If there is a wall behind your monitor consider bouncing light of it with a lamp, so we can see your lovely face. Alternatively shine light onto you from an angle.

### Software requirements

__TL;DR: get Firefox, sign up at the link you will be getting via registration email (opens 19th August 2021).__

The following software is required:
- Fairly recent Firefox browser (please update when possible)

The following software is strongly recommended as a fallback option:
- Fairly recent Chromium based browser (please update when possible)
- Zoom Client

Like last year we will be using the web-based chat-application [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/) at https://chat.forth-standard.org - no installation required, hosted by Forth Committee Members to help privacy concerns.
You will receive a signup link in via email after you registered on this site.
All communication is within this chat-application, we ask you to sign in within the `Get together` timeframe.

For the video conferences themselfes we will be using [BigBlueButton](https://bigbluebutton.org/) hosted by Gerald Wodni, as [senfcall.de](https://senfcall.de/) was dropping some connections from the US.
__Links to the conference rooms will be provided in chat-application Mattermost__.

If this should fail we will fall back to [Zoom](https://zoom.us/). Consider installing their client beforehand.

Please visit our testing call which will be announced in [chat](https://chat.forth-standard.org/), especially if you had issues last year.

## Registration process

The following procedure is very different from previous years, please bear with us.

1. Please register if you want to attend, also if you do not know yet if you will be able to attend. Registrations this year are not binding until the prepayment has been received, see below.
2. The decision for __`Rome`/`Online`__ will be announced on __20th July__ 13:37
    - If __`Online`__ is decided, the conference and the standards meeting will be held online, on the same dates.
    - If __`Rome`__ is decided, proceed to 3.
3. Please transfer at least 30% of your total as soon as possible, it must arrive on our account by 3rd August to ensure your room reservation (required by the hotel - we are forwarding the collective payment). Feel free to transfer the full sum right away, should we need to cancel at short notice, we will return all but the 30% downpayment to the hotel. Please transfer the remainder to arrive no later than 31st August.
4. We assume that the conference can now take place and the pandemic is nothing more but a conversational topic.
5. If however the conference has to be cancelled because of a _2nd wave_ or the like, the conference will be moved to 2021, your 30% down payment are not refundable in that case, but will be valid for the next year in the same hotel.

If you have any open questions to this process, do not hesitate to email us ( Claudia -dot- Wodni on Gmail, Subject: "EuroForth 2020 Registration").
