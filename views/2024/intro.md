This years EuroForth will be held in the vibrant city of Newcastle upon Tyne.
We will be situated in the dramatic post industrial landsape of the quayside,
adjacent to the Baltic Art Gallery (a re-purposed flour mill) and the futuristic Sage music venue.
The Millenium Footbrige leads across the river to the Newcastle Quayside, where we can find an assortment of international restaraunts.

For partners who have time to explore the town,
there is an electric bus service up to the Georgian heart of Newcastle with its monument of Earl Grey,
the prime minister who managed to find time, between drinking cups of tea,
to oversee the passage of the Great Reform Act and the Abolition of Slavery Act.
Nearby are the Laing Art Gallery, the Theatre Royal, and the historic Grainger Market.
Right by Grey's Monument, the Eldon Square Shopping Centre houses the famous Newcastle department store Fenwicks,
in addition to John Lewis and Marks and Spencer.
Newcastle is within easy reach of the coast and countryside.
Jesmond Dene Park offers a beautiful wooded valley in the heart of town.
